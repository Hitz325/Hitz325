- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tom!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java, JavaScript, and web development in general. I have used Angular in the past, but enjoy using Springboot to create web apps. 
I'm always eager to learn a new way to put my apps together. I most recently was able to get an app I created to deploy through Heroku and was able to make it persistent
with a remote database.

I have previous coding experience in C++ while studying for my undergrad degree. I look forward to expanding my knowledge base and using my skills to help solve 
real world problems.
